    "model_response": "Based on the responses provided, the total score is 14 which falls under the \"Developing\" category. This suggests that the company is at the initial stages of operationalizing ESG objectives. There is significant work to be done to embed these objectives into the company's operations, decision-making processes, and overall strategy.\n\nTop 5 Categories for Improvement and Roadmap:\n\n1. Governance: The company seems to have a weak governance structure in terms of overseeing ESG issues. It is critical that the company strengthens its board's role in ESG oversight and ensure that there are robust processes and controls in place to manage ESG risks and opportunities. This can be achieved by providing regular ESG-specific training for board members and integrating ESG risk assessment into the company's existing risk management framework.\n\n2. Risk Management: The company's risk identification processes and its integration into the overall risk framework score very low. The company should work on developing a comprehensive ESG risk identification and management strategy, which is regularly updated and integrated into the overall risk management framework.\n\n3. Metrics and Targets: The company has not adopted relevant and comprehensive ESG metrics and targets. The company should identify key ESG metrics relevant to its operations and industry, set ambitious but achievable targets, and regularly track and report on these.\n\n4. Reporting and Disclosure: The company's sustainability reporting does not adhere to recognized frameworks and standards, and its accuracy and reliability are questionable. The company should adopt recognized reporting frameworks such as GRI, SASB or TCFD, ensure the accuracy of data through third-party audits, and improve the transparency of its sustainability reporting.\n\n5. Stakeholder Engagement: The company's engagement with stakeholders on sustainability issues and its feedback mechanisms are not effective. The company should establish open and regular channels of communication with its stakeholders, actively seek their feedback, and be responsive to their concerns and suggestions.\n\nRemember, these improvement areas are a starting point. The company will need to continuously review and update its ESG strategy and objectives as it progresses in its ESG journey."
