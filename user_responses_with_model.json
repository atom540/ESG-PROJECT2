    "model_response": "Based on the responses provided, the total score is 34 which falls under the \"Developing\" category. This suggests that the company is at the initial stages of operationalizing ESG objectives. There is significant work to be done to embed these objectives into the company's operations, decision-making processes, and overall strategy.\n\nTop 5 Categories for Improvement and Roadmap:\n\n1. Strategy: The company seems to struggle with integrating ESG considerations into its overall strategy. This is a crucial aspect that needs more attention, as it will drive all other ESG-related initiatives. It is recommended to start by setting clear and ambitious long-term ESG targets that reflect the company's sustainability vision.\n\n2. Metrics and Targets: The current ESG metrics tracking seems to be non-existent. The company needs to establish relevant and comprehensive ESG metrics, and use these to assess performance against ESG targets. This will help track progress and identify areas that need improvement.\n\n3. Reporting and Disclosure: The company is not adhering to recognized frameworks and standards in its sustainability reporting. Improve the accuracy and reliability of ESG reporting by applying recognized frameworks such as GRI or SASB.\n\n4. Compliance and Alignment: The company scores low in compliance with local and international ESG-related regulations, as well as in alignment with ESG frameworks. It is recommended to establish a robust compliance system and align practices with frameworks such as IFRS S1 and SASB standards.\n\n5. Innovation and Continuous Improvement: The company does not seem to promote continuous improvement or innovation in its ESG practices. Encourage innovation by creating an environment where new ideas are welcomed and rewarded, and continuously review and improve ESG practices to stay ahead."
